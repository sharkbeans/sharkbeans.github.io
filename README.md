# sharkbeans-site

A static personal developer website built with Astro, TypeScript, and KAPLAY. The homepage is a
typographic world: a small sprite walks around the actual rendered content, headings, project
blocks, dividers, which double as the level geometry. It is intentionally not a resume or CV
site. The main identity is a public handle, not a full legal name.

## Purpose

This project is a personal home on the web for:

- projects and case studies
- blog posts and development notes
- software and hardware notes
- a short personal About page
- public profile links
- a homepage you can walk around in, without gating any of the above behind it

The design target is a normal, readable personal site first. The world system is an enhancement
layered on top, not a replacement for it.

## Tech stack

- Astro
- TypeScript
- KAPLAY
- Astro content collections
- MDX
- semantic HTML
- modern CSS
- GitHub Actions
- GitHub Pages

## Local development

Node `24.18.1` is pinned in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Astro dev server defaults to `http://localhost:4321`.

## Production build

```bash
npm run check
npm run build
npm run preview
```

`npm run check` runs Astro diagnostics and TypeScript checks. `npm run build` outputs the fully static site to `dist/`.

## GitHub Pages deployment

The workflow lives at [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) and does the following:

1. Checks out the repository.
2. Sets up Node from `.nvmrc`.
3. Installs dependencies with `npm ci`.
4. Builds the Astro site.
5. Uploads the `dist/` folder as the GitHub Pages artifact.
6. Deploys that artifact to GitHub Pages.

To enable deployment:

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In GitHub, open `Settings -> Pages`.
3. Set the source to `GitHub Actions`.
4. Make sure your default deploy branch matches the workflow trigger, currently `main`.

### Base-path handling

The site is configured with `base: "/"` in [astro.config.ts](astro.config.ts), matching the GitHub Pages user-site URL `https://sharkbeans.github.io`. Every internal link, asset path, and the sprite sheet URL is still built from `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` rather than hardcoded root-relative paths, so the site stays portable if it ever moves back under a subpath. See `src/data/world.ts`, `src/components/world/world.ts`, and `Footer.astro` for examples.

## Custom-domain setup

The site is served at `https://sharkbeans.is-a.dev`, a custom domain registered through [is-a-dev/register](https://github.com/is-a-dev/register). It is still built as the GitHub Pages user site, so the repository must stay named exactly `sharkbeans.github.io`; renaming it would push the site back to a `/repo-name/` subpath and `base` would have to change with it. GitHub redirects the old `sharkbeans.github.io` URL to the custom domain automatically.

The domain is wired up in four places, and it has to be all four — the DNS record alone only gets requests to GitHub, which then 404s unless Pages recognises the hostname:

1. `site` in [src/data/profile.json](src/data/profile.json) holds the real domain. (`siteLabel` stays `sharkbeans`; it is the display name used for `<title>` and `og:site_name`, not a URL.)
2. [public/CNAME](public/CNAME) contains only the final domain, so it lands at the root of the build output.
3. The is-a.dev DNS record `CNAME sharkbeans -> sharkbeans.github.io`, merged upstream.
4. The Pages custom domain on this repository, set with:

   ```sh
   gh api -X PUT repos/sharkbeans/sharkbeans.github.io/pages -f cname=sharkbeans.is-a.dev
   ```

   GitHub provisions the Let's Encrypt certificate after this is set, which takes a few minutes; enforce-HTTPS turns itself off until the certificate is issued and can be turned back on afterwards.

`base` stays `"/"` throughout. Canonical URLs, Open Graph metadata, RSS, the sitemap, and `robots.txt` are all derived from `site` and `base`, so skipping step 1 leaves them pointing at the wrong host even while the domain itself works.

## The typographic world

The homepage (`src/pages/index.astro`) is the level. There is no separate minimap, no hardcoded
coordinate table, and no second "game" living beside the real content. A sprite walks in free 2D
space over the rendered page, and the DOM itself supplies the collision geometry.

### How DOM elements become collision geometry

`DomCollisionSystem` (`src/components/world/DomCollisionSystem.ts`) queries elements marked with
`data-world-*` attributes, reads their `getBoundingClientRect()`, and converts each rect to
**document coordinates** (`rect + window.scrollX/scrollY`). Because everything is cached in
document space, scrolling never invalidates the cache; only real layout changes do. Rects are
recomputed on:

- initial load
- `document.fonts.ready`
- each image's `load` event (skipped if already complete)
- a debounced (~150ms) `resize` / `orientationchange`
- a `ResizeObserver` on the homepage's single content wrapper (`#world-content`)

This keeps `getBoundingClientRect()` calls batched and off the per-frame hot path. Rendering reads
the cached rects and just subtracts the *current* scroll position, with no re-measurement per frame.

### `data-world-*` attributes

| Attribute | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `data-world-solid` | Element becomes a padded collision rectangle. The player cannot walk through it and slides along its edges. |
| `data-world-interactable="id"` | Element becomes a proximity target. `id` must match an entry in `src/data/world.ts`. Can be combined with `data-world-solid` on the same element. |
| `data-world-spawn="id"` | A zero-size marker; its position is a named safe-placement point (see Spawn points below). |
| `data-world-bounds` | Optional. If present, its rect defines the player's movement bounds instead of the whole `#world-content` wrapper. |

**Adding a new solid element:** add `data-world-solid` to a heading, image, code block, or grouped
content block, not to individual body-text lines, inline links, tags, or list items. Prefer one
rectangle around a whole paragraph/group over many tiny ones; the system is built for "a few dozen
landmarks," not "one rect per word."

**Adding a new interactable:** add `data-world-interactable="my-id"` to the element, then add a
matching entry (`title`, `description`, `href`, `ctaLabel`, `promptLabel`) to
`worldInteractables` in [src/data/world.ts](src/data/world.ts). Interactables don't need to be solid; see the `about` link in the "elsewhere on the site" list, which is interactable but walk-through so it doesn't block the exit corridor.

**Adding a spawn point:** drop `<span data-world-spawn="my-id" aria-hidden="true"></span>` next to
(not inside) the content it should spawn near.

### Spawn points

Spawn markers are resolved by `SpawnPointSystem`, never hardcoded as pixel coordinates. On
request, it looks up the marker's current document position and, if that point now falls inside a
solid rect (e.g. after a layout change), searches outward in a small spiral for the nearest free
spot. Placement only happens on explicit triggers: initial load (`"intro"`) and clicking an in-page
anchor link (`href="#section"`), which finds the `data-world-spawn` marker inside the target
section and repositions the player there, with no forced walking sequence.

### Replacing the player sprite

The sprite sheet is generated, not hand-drawn or sourced from another game. Regenerate it with:

```bash
node scripts/generate-sprite.mjs
```

This writes `public/assets/sprites/player.png` (a 64×64, 4-column × 4-row sheet: one row per
direction (down, left, right, up), 4 walk frames each, frame 0 doubles as idle) and
`public/assets/sprites/player.json` (frame layout + anim map, for reference/regeneration tooling).
It's a hand-rolled RGBA PNG encoder using only `node:zlib`, with no image dependency.

**License:** the sprite is original placeholder art generated for this project: public domain /
CC0, replace freely. No ripped or unlicensed game assets are used anywhere in this project; the
only third-party art in the repo is the footstep VFX described in
[Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements), used under its explicit free license.

To use different art, replace `public/assets/sprites/player.png` (and update the `sliceX`/`sliceY`
and `anims` in `ANIMS` inside `src/components/world/world.ts` if the frame layout changes).
`PlayerController`'s state shape (position, velocity, facing, `isMoving`) doesn't need to change;
only the rendering/anim-name mapping in `world.ts` does.

### Reading mode

The "Reading mode" button (always visible near the top of the homepage) hides the sprite, disables
collision-driven movement and the camera's edge-follow scrolling, and restores completely normal
page scrolling; nothing about the underlying content changes. The preference is remembered for
the current tab via `sessionStorage` (`world:reading-mode`).

### Mobile / responsive fallback

Manual movement requires both a wide viewport and a fine pointer:
`(min-width: 64rem) and (pointer: fine)`, re-evaluated live via `matchMedia` listeners. Below that:

- **≥420px wide:** the sprite becomes a small decorative, non-interactive companion pinned to a
  slim gutter on the right edge of the viewport, with its vertical position following scroll. It
  never overlaps the content column.
- **<420px wide:** the sprite is hidden entirely to guarantee there's no chance of covering text
  or causing overflow.

Manual keyboard movement, DOM collision, and camera follow are all inert in this mode; mobile
just gets normal scrolling, which is the point.

### Weather-reactive foot effects

`WeatherState.ts` fetches Penang's current precipitation and day/night state from
[Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) (no API key required), cached in `sessionStorage` for ~20
minutes, and falls back silently to a clear/day default if the request fails. This is a decorative
detail, so an error state would be more distracting than just not showing rain. `FootEffectSystem.ts`
uses only the `condition` half of that snapshot to spawn a small, short-lived splash mark at the
player's foot point in step with their stride, only while it's raining in Penang. Nothing spawns
while idle, crouched, the weather is clear, or with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` set. This is
intentionally scoped to the player's immediate footprint rather than an ambient page-wide overlay;
see the sprite asset in [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements).

The `period` (day/night) value is tracked but not yet wired to any visual; it exists so a future
lighting tweak doesn't need a new fetch, and so the dev debug panel below has something concrete to
toggle.

**Dev-only debug panel:** in `astro dev` (never in a production build, gated on
`import.meta.env.DEV`, statically stripped from the build output), a small panel in the
bottom-right lets you force `condition` (clear/rain) and `period` (day/night) instead of waiting on
real Penang weather, plus a "live" button to clear the override. The `?debugWorld=1` collision
overlay's on-screen readout also prints the current weather snapshot so you can confirm an override
took effect even before period drives any visual.

### Collision debug mode

Append `?debugWorld=1` to the URL (or run `astro dev`, which enables it automatically) to draw:
cached solid-rect outlines, the player hitbox, each interactable's outline, the current proximity
radius, spawn-point markers, and a small on-screen readout (world position, scroll position,
collision-body counts, current mode). It never renders unless explicitly requested in production.

### Performance notes

- `getBoundingClientRect()` is only called during a batched `recalculate()` pass, never per frame.
- Solid/interactable rects are cached in document coordinates, so scroll never triggers
  re-measurement.
- Resize handling is debounced (~150ms for collision geometry, ~200ms for the KAPLAY canvas
  remount described below).
- KAPLAY sizes its internal drawing buffer from the canvas's *parent* element's size unless you
  pass `width`/`height` explicitly. `world.ts` always passes the live viewport size and, because
  that internal buffer isn't resized in place by the engine, a real viewport resize is handled by
  disposing (`k.quit()`) and re-mounting the renderer rather than fighting a stale buffer.
- KAPLAY itself is loaded via a dynamic `import()` scheduled with `requestIdleCallback`, after the
  static HTML has already rendered; a failed import leaves the page as an ordinary static site.

## Accessibility

- All meaningful content is semantic HTML, fully present and readable without any JavaScript.
- The canvas is `pointer-events: none` at all times; it never intercepts clicks or touch
  scrolling. Every real interactive element (project links, nav, buttons) is a normal DOM node
  underneath it.
- Keyboard movement/interact keys are never intercepted while focus is inside an input, textarea,
  select, contenteditable region, or an open dialog (see `isTypingTarget`/`isPaused` in
  `InputController.ts`).
- Tab navigation and native focus outlines work exactly as on any other page.
- The proximity highlight never relies on color alone; it pairs an outline with a `›` marker.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables the smooth camera-follow easing (snaps instead) and
  the global reduced-motion rules in `global.css` still apply site-wide.
- No audio anywhere.
- Reading mode gives a persistent, one-click way to turn all of the above off completely.

## Other routes

`/projects`, `/blog`, `/stats`, `/uses`, `/about`, `/lab`, and individual project/post pages carry the same
dark theme but do not mount the world system; they're plain, fast, readable pages. `Footer.astro`
has a tiny purely-decorative CSS `steps()` sprite animation (same sheet, no KAPLAY) as the only
world-adjacent touch outside the homepage.

## Visual theme

- [src/styles/tokens.css](src/styles/tokens.css): the dark palette (near-black background, warm off-white text, phosphor-green accent, sparing cyan) and the three font stacks (condensed/grotesque display, sans body, mono metadata/nav).
- [src/styles/global.css](src/styles/global.css): base element styles, the subtle static scanline texture, shared layout primitives.
- [src/styles/world.css](src/styles/world.css): canvas positioning, reading-mode toggle, interactable highlight, debug overlay, preview dialog.
- [src/styles/prose.css](src/styles/prose.css): long-form article/MDX typography, unchanged in structure from before, just re-themed via CSS variables.

No `@font-face`/webfonts are loaded; every font stack falls back through system fonts, so there's
nothing extra to download.

## Changing the handle

Update the public identity in [src/data/profile.ts](src/data/profile.ts):

- `handle`
- `siteLabel`
- `site`
- `firstName`
- `introHeading`
- `intro`
- `homeBlurb`

No `fullName` field is used anywhere in the site.

## Updating profile links

Edit:

- [src/data/profile.ts](src/data/profile.ts) for global site metadata
- [src/data/socials.ts](src/data/socials.ts) for GitHub and other public profiles

Contact info (email) is intentionally omitted from the public site. Unset placeholder values are
kept commented out in `socials.ts` and `uses.ts` rather than shown live.

## Adding or updating projects

Project summary data lives in [src/data/projects.ts](src/data/projects.ts).

To add a project:

1. Add a typed entry to the `projects` array.
2. Create a matching project page in `src/pages/projects/`.
3. Add screenshots or diagrams in `public/assets/screenshots/` if needed.
4. Mark `featured: true` if it should appear on the homepage.
5. If it should be walkable/interactive on the homepage, add it to `src/pages/index.astro` with
   `data-world-solid data-world-interactable="your-slug"` and a matching entry in
   `src/data/world.ts`.

Current case-study pages:

- [src/pages/projects/objekt-tools.astro](src/pages/projects/objekt-tools.astro)
- [src/pages/projects/mybeli.astro](src/pages/projects/mybeli.astro)
- [src/pages/projects/minecommit.astro](src/pages/projects/minecommit.astro)

## Adding blog posts

Blog content uses Astro content collections with MDX files in [src/content/blog](src/content/blog).

Required frontmatter:

- `title`
- `description`
- `pubDate`
- `tags`
- `draft`

Optional frontmatter:

- `updatedDate`
- `heroImage`
- `canonicalUrl`

To add a new post:

1. Create a new `.md` or `.mdx` file in `src/content/blog/`.
2. Add frontmatter matching the schema in [src/content.config.ts](src/content.config.ts).
3. Write the article body.
4. Set `draft: false` when the post is ready to be treated as published.

## Updating the Uses page

Edit [src/data/uses.ts](src/data/uses.ts). The page is data-driven, so you usually do not need to touch the Astro template unless you want to change layout. A short teaser for this page also appears on the homepage as one of the walkable landmarks.

## Future API integration

[src/services/api.ts](src/services/api.ts) is a small placeholder service layer for future public-data fetches.

Important constraints:

- GitHub Pages does not run server code.
- Safe public APIs may be fetched directly from the browser when CORS allows it.
- Secret-backed requests must not be embedded in client code.
- Secret-backed or rate-limited integrations need an external API, Worker, or build-time automation.

`/stats` (see below) is the first integration built on this pattern: build-time fetch + committed
fallback, no browser-side requests.

Possible later expansions:

- live project status
- a guestbook
- a contact endpoint backed by another service
- hidden homepage achievements
- a small terminal experiment

## GitHub stats page

`/stats` renders a GitHub contribution calendar, language mix, a commit-time-of-day histogram, and
a top-repos list. All of it is fetched at build time by
[scripts/fetch-github-stats.mjs](scripts/fetch-github-stats.mjs)
and written to `src/data/generated/github.json`, which
[src/data/github.ts](src/data/github.ts) types and re-exports
for the page and its components
([ContribGraph](src/components/ContribGraph.astro),
[LanguageBar](src/components/LanguageBar.astro),
[CommitClock](src/components/CommitClock.astro)). Nothing on
this page makes a request from the visitor's browser.

The contribution calendar and commit-time histogram are only available through GitHub's GraphQL
API, which always requires auth; there's no public, unauthenticated equivalent. The repo/language
data doesn't need a token, so `github.json` ships with that part live and the calendar/clock as a
zero-filled placeholder, matching the "visible placeholder" convention used on the Uses page.

To make the calendar and commit clock live:

1. Create a **classic personal access token** with only the `read:user` scope checked (nothing
   else). Fine-grained tokens don't reliably expose the `contributionsCollection` GraphQL field
   this needs, so classic is the one that actually works here.
2. Add it as a repository secret named `GH_STATS_TOKEN` (Settings → Secrets and variables →
   Actions).
3. The deploy workflow already runs `node scripts/fetch-github-stats.mjs` before `astro build`,
   on every push to `main` and on a daily schedule (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`), so the page
   stays fresh even on days with no commits here.

Without the secret, the workflow step logs a warning and the build proceeds with whatever is
currently committed in `github.json`; a missing token never breaks the deploy.

To refresh the fallback locally: `GH_STATS_TOKEN=<token> node scripts/fetch-github-stats.mjs`.

### Folding in private repos (language mix + commit clock only)

`GH_STATS_TOKEN` (`read:user`) can't see repo contents at all, so private repos are invisible to
the language mix and commit clock by default; only public repos are scanned. To auto-discover
every private repo on the account and fold its language bytes and commit timestamps into those two
aggregates, without ever exposing the repo itself (name, description, URL, and star count are
never fetched beyond what identifies it for the query, let alone written to `github.json`):

1. Create a **fine-grained PAT** scoped to **"All repositories"** (not hand-picked ones, so newly
   created private repos are picked up automatically) with repository permission
   **Contents: Read-only** and nothing else. This is intentionally a separate token from
   `GH_STATS_TOKEN`; it stays read-only and content-scoped, so a leak of either token exposes as
   little as possible.
2. Add it as a repository secret named `GH_STATS_PRIVATE_TOKEN`.

It's optional and independent of `GH_STATS_TOKEN`; omit it and private-repo folding is silently
skipped, same graceful-degradation behavior as the main token.

### Naming a private repo in Top Repositories

By default every private repo folded in above stays anonymous; its name is read (to run the
query) but never written to `github.json`. Printing a repo's name on a public page makes it
search-indexable even though the link itself 404s for non-collaborators, so naming one is an
explicit, per-repo opt-in, not automatic:

Add a repository **variable** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables tab, not
Secrets; it's just repo names, not sensitive) named `GH_STATS_SHOWCASE_REPOS` with a
comma-separated `owner/name` list, e.g. `sharkbeans/my-private-elixir-app`. Only repos listed there
get their name, description, URL, and star count written out and shown (with a "private" badge) in
Top Repositories; every other private repo stays folded in anonymously as before.

### Folding in maintained forks

Every query above filters out forks (`isFork: false`), which is right for the forks you clone
just to read someone else's code and wrong for the ones you actually maintain and release —
those should count in the language mix and commit clock and show up in Top Repositories, flagged
as a fork with a link back to upstream.

The list defaults to `sharkbeans/minecommit`, hardcoded as `DEFAULT_FORK_REPOS` in
[scripts/fetch-github-stats.mjs](scripts/fetch-github-stats.mjs) — deliberately *not* wired to a
repository variable the way `GH_STATS_SHOWCASE_REPOS` is. GitHub Actions resolves an unset
`vars.*` reference to an empty string rather than omitting the env var, so wiring it the same way
would mean `GH_STATS_FORK_REPOS` is always "set" (to `""`) in CI, silently overriding the
in-script default with an empty list on every run where nobody has explicitly configured a repo
variable. Leaving it out of the workflow keeps the env var genuinely unset in CI, so the default
actually applies.

To change which forks are folded in, edit `DEFAULT_FORK_REPOS` directly, or set
`GH_STATS_FORK_REPOS` (comma-separated `owner/name`) when running the script locally — it
overrides the default, and an explicit empty string disables fork folding entirely. Each listed
fork is fetched with its own query (no token beyond `GH_STATS_TOKEN` needed for a public fork),
and the commit clock still only counts commits I authored, so a fork's contribution to the clock
reflects my own commits, not upstream's.

## Content rules already followed

- no full legal name is displayed
- no resume or CV page exists
- no employment timeline exists
- no ripped or unlicensed game assets are used anywhere; the one exception is properly licensed
  and credited in [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)
- all current data is local and static

## Acknowledgements

- Footstep splash VFX (`public/assets/vfx/footstep-splash.png`) and the bullet detonation VFX
  (`public/assets/vfx/bullet-blast.png`) are cropped from DryRain's
  [Pixel Platformer VFX General Pack 1](https://dryrainent.itch.io/ppvfx-general-1), used under its
  free-for-personal-and-commercial-projects license (modification allowed, reselling the pack
  itself is not; attribution isn't required by the license but is given here anyway). The full pack
  (dust, sparks, smoke, pulses, beams, debris, and more) is kept in
  `assets-src/vfx/ppvfx-general-pack-1/`, not served by the site, just checked in so future effects
  don't require re-downloading. See that folder's `NOTICE.md` for details.
- Penang weather/day-night data comes from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/), a free,
  keyless weather API; see [Weather-reactive foot effects](#weather-reactive-foot-effects).

## Known limitations

- Two blog posts remain visible drafts. Drafts render with `noindex` but are still listed in the sitemap.
- The MyBeli architecture image is an illustrative SVG diagram rather than a real screenshot, by design (nothing to screenshot for that part of the system).
- The world system currently exists only on the homepage, by design; other pages stay simple and fast.
- Axis-separated collision resolution is intentionally simple (no full physics/spatial-hash solver); in rare multi-rect-overlap cases the player can be nudged slightly further than the strictly nearest free point. This has not been an issue in testing at the current homepage density.
- The Open Graph image is an SVG placeholder; you may want a custom PNG later for wider crawler compatibility.
- The current project pages for private work stay intentionally high-level to avoid exposing sensitive internals.
